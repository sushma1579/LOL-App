 In this project, we are developing a daily joke Android application using OpenAI GPT API. 
 The app offers users the ability to request a new joke from atleast one of five categories(atleast) : animals, jobs, kids, cars, and others. 
 The app will utilize the OpenGPT API to generate jokes for each category, which will be then displayed to the user within the Android Studio interface or a physical Android Mobile device. 
 Further a group of individuals will be evaluating the jokes and rank them from 1 to 5, with 5 being a very good joke and 1 being not a good joke. 
 The findings will show that OpenGPT is proficient at generating jokes in the certain category but has some room for improvement in the other categories.
